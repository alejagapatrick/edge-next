## What is Edge? 

Edge is a piece of software written on top of Next.js to create a Dynamic API / Dynamic Dashboard and fully functional site to help makers, developers and other creators to deploy a minimum viable product in minutes.

The main features of Edge are:
- Dynamic content types and permissions, and APIs.
- Comments on content types
- Users APIs (login, register, update)
- Emails (email verification, contact emails) templates and implementation
- Dynamic admin dashboard for all the content, comments and users.
- Block users the access to the site
- CSS themes that the user can change
- User activity log
- Login / Register with social providers
- A set of pre-implemented components
- PWA (Progressive Web APP)
- SSG (Static Site Generation) for static pages with markdown
- Easy to deploy

If you want to read about all the features you can check the [documentation](./static-pages/p/documentation.md) or check the [Website Demo](https://edge-next.now.sh/).

You can login with the following credentials:
- Admin: admin@demo.com | password: admin
- User: user@demo.com | password: user

## How do I use Edge?

This tool is *not provided* as a package or framework you can add into your existing solutions. It is a solution by itself and it can fit your project for a determined set of use-cases. 

To use this tool:
- 1 Download or clone the repository
- 2 Do `yarn` or `npm install` 
- 3 Do `yarn dev` to launch your site (as any NextJS application)
- 4 Edit `edge.config.js` to add your own texts and content types or permissions
  - You can learn more on how to create new content types, permissions and themes in our tutorials
- 5 Deploy! We recommend services like [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
  - Check how to configure all the different providers in the documentation. You will need to create different set of environment variables and register in the different services like Email and Database.
